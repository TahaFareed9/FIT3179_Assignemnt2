    <h1>Blood Donations in Malaysia</h1>

    <p>
        Blood donations are a critical lifeline for healthcare systems, 
        ensuring the availability of a constant supply of essential blood 
        components across Malaysia. Patients of numerous kinds of medical 
        conidtions are in need of blood transfusions every day, and blood 
        donations is one way they can receive the help the need.
    </p>

    <h2>Blood Donations by State (2023)</h2>

    <P>
        There exists some large regional disparites in blood donation 
        levels, which may suggest the need for targeted efforts to raise 
        awareness about the importance of donating blood in under-represented 
        states such as Kelantan. This would increase the blood donaton levels 
        in these states, and therefore creating a more stable supply of blood 
        components.
    </P>

    <div id="map"></div>

    <h2>Blood Donations in Selected States (2018-2023)</h2>

    <p>
        Blood donation trends overall remained stable over the last six years, 
        with only a slight drop during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
        There is only one expeption to this trend, that being the state Kedah, 
        which saw more fluctuation in blood donation levels, which could indicate 
        the existence of an underlying issue that is worth investigating into.
    </p>

    <h2>Blood Donation Distribution by Blood Type in Selected States (2023)</h2>

    <p>
        The blood types that have the highest demand are O- and O+ due to O- 
        blood type being a universal donor, and most blood types being able 
        to receive blood transfusions of O+ type. Meanwhile, the blood types 
        with the least demand are AB+ as it is a universal recipient, and AB- 
        as it is able to receive many types of blood. This is clearly reflected 
        in charts' blood donations type distribution, and it shows that most 
        states are able to meet this demand.
